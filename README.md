# Assembly2014
Assembly programs written in community college

The first few labs and practices are quite trivial. The first lab is a "Hello World" program, so there is not too much going on.
In fact, I do not even have practice 1-3 anymore. Also missing is practice 9.
The most interesting programs are the midterm and the final (and rightfully so), although many of the latter projects are quite involved.
